# =============================================================================
# Rust CI/CD Pipeline for API Server
#
# This workflow ensures code quality, security, and functionality by running
# comprehensive checks on every push and pull request to the main branch.
#
# Pipeline stages:
# 1. Setup: Install Rust toolchain and setup caching for faster builds
# 2. Build: Verify code compiles successfully
# 3. Format: Enforce consistent code formatting
# 4. Lint: Run clippy for code quality and best practices
# 5. Test: Execute test suite to verify functionality
# 6. Security: Scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
